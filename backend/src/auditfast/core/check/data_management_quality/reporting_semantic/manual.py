"""Data Management & Quality · Reporting / Semantic — manual / attestation checks (auto-generated).

These industry-standard points are not verified from Fabric data today, so the
engine never runs them (manual=True); they exist so the catalogue is a complete,
attestable checklist. Each carries:
  - `required`   — expected in every project (True) or situational (False);
  - `automation` — ROADMAP (automatable once the provider integrates the needed
    Fabric API) or MANUAL (only a human can attest).

Do not edit by hand — regenerate with build-manual-checks.py.
