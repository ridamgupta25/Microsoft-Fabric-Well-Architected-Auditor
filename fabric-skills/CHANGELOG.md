# Changelog

User-facing changes for the public Microsoft Fabric Skills release.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.9] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- **`skills/azmon-mirroredcatalogs-operations-cli`** -- onboards Azure Monitor / Application Insights / Log Analytics observability data into Microsoft Fabric as a Mirrored Catalog item and turns that telemetry into business-impact insights by correlating observability signals with business data, ending in ready-to-paste Operations Agent instructions.

### Changed
- **`skills/semantic-model-authoring`** -- removed instructions that referenced the upcoming Copilot file format.
- **`databricks-migration`** -- expanded Databricks-to-Fabric guidance for `dbutils` replacements, notebook parameters, environments, Lakehouse table references, MLflow, and workload mappings.

### Fixed
- **`skills/activator-authoring-cli`** -- treat schema-only, zero-row, non-emitting, or stale signal sources as missing source data so the skill stops and asks for source details instead of force-fitting a rule onto an unrelated existing item.
- **`skills/activator-consumption-cli`** -- route read-only "show me all Activators" prompts to consumption guidance instead of the authoring skill.
- **`check-updates`** -- detects marketplace plugins, direct plugins, positively identified Git clones, and loose skills copied or materialized from a file or URL; isolates the seven-day cache by installed entry or clone root; provides host-appropriate Copilot, Claude, Cursor, or safe no-command update guidance; and offers an explicit, confirmation-gated migration from official loose copies to a complete current plugin bundle.
- **`databricks-migration`** -- corrected mount and notebook parameter guidance, and now requires inventory and constraint clarification before recommending a workspace-wide Fabric topology.

## [0.3.8] - 2026-07-16

### Added
- **Public issue routing** -- the public repository now provides dedicated bug and feature issue forms with a required owner-area selector and automatic `area:<slug>` labeling.

### Changed
- **Installation and update guidance** -- the public README now clarifies the scope of the main and focused plugin bundles and documents both per-bundle updates and `copilot plugin update --all`.
- **Skill routing boundaries** -- improved selection across catalog search, Dataflows Gen1 save-as, Spark authoring/consumption/operations, Warehouse SQL, MLV operations, and end-to-end medallion prompts. Ad hoc Livy session execution now routes to `spark-consumption-cli`.
- **`eventstream-authoring-cli`** -- user-defined topology node names now require alphanumeric PascalCase; the platform-generated `DefaultStream` naming exception is documented.

### Fixed
- **`dataflows-authoring-cli`** -- connector capability answers now use the tenant's live `supportedConnectionTypes` endpoint, and completion summaries identify the actual definition persist endpoint used.
- **`dataflows-save-as-authoring-cli`** -- readiness output now consistently uses the canonical `Save-As Readiness Snapshot` heading.

## [0.3.7] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- **`skills/sqldb-authoring-cli/SKILL.md`, `skills/sqldb-consumption-cli/SKILL.md`, `skills/sqldb-operations-cli/SKILL.md`** -- new SQL Database in Fabric skills (authoring, read-only consumption, and performance/diagnostics).

### Changed
- **`skills/powerbi-report-authoring`**, **`skills/powerbi-report-design`**, **`skills/powerbi-report-management`**, **`skills/powerbi-report-planning`** -- refreshed guidance (no routing or version changes): `cardVisual` vs. legacy `multiRowCard` anti-patterns and multi-value card guidance, `catalog describe` role-name verification (`Data` vs. legacy `Fields`), CLI `@latest` install/update guidance, PBIR `.platform`/`version.json`/`pages.json` scaffolding clarifications, conditional-formatting data-bars and single-hue gradient guidance, `fontColor` vs. `fontColorPrimary` handling, Desktop unsaved-changes pre-reload check, slicer tooltip `visualTooltip.show` requirement, and cartesian/non-cartesian per-series color guidance.
- **`skills/dataflows-authoring-cli`** -- treats a terminal, non-retriable Dataflow Gen2 refresh outcome as a stop condition instead of a debugging loop: a refresh/LRO job reaching terminal `Failed`/`Cancelled`, a backend error with `isRetriable: false`, or a workspace-wide `UnknownException` now surfaces the raw `failureReason` and ends. Refresh-failure isolation is bounded to a single `executeQuery` attempt. The refresh-poll examples (bash + PowerShell) poll a bounded loop over the known terminal set (`Completed`/`Failed`/`Cancelled`/`Deduped`), treat `Deduped` as concurrency (another refresh already running) rather than a failure, and surface `.failureReason` on `Failed`/`Cancelled`.

### Fixed
- **`skills/powerbi-report-authoring`** -- schema-version guidance no longer points at the unpublished `visualContainer/2.10.0` schema (which returns 404 on live `$schema` validation); it now copies `$schema` from an existing `visual.json` and otherwise falls back to the published `2.9.0`. Fixes microsoft/skills-for-fabric#55.
- **`skills/powerbi-report-authoring`** -- map fallback guidance uses the valid `clusteredBarChart` visual type (was the invalid `barChartClustered`) and no longer mislabels `shapeMap` as a legacy visual (only `map`/`filledMap` are legacy Bing Maps visuals; verified via `powerbi-report-author validate`).
- **`skills/powerbi-report-design`** -- accessibility target-size criterion corrected from WCAG 2.5.5 (Target Size Enhanced, AAA, ≥44px) to 2.5.8 (Target Size Minimum, AA, ≥24px), and contrast-ratio examples corrected. Fixes microsoft/skills-for-fabric#43.
- **`skills/powerbi-report-authoring`** -- `version.json` scaffolding guidance now stresses preserving the full scaffolded file including `$schema`, avoiding the local-validate-passes-but-Fabric-`updateDefinition`-rejects mismatch. Relates to microsoft/skills-for-fabric#35.
- **`skills/activator-authoring-cli`** -- when a requested alert or rule targets a signal that no discoverable source in the workspace exposes, the skill now stops and asks which source and fields provide it instead of creating a Reflex or modifying an unrelated existing item to force-fit the request.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- **`skills/dataflows-authoring-cli`** -- preview-and-confirm step in the dataflow creation flow: the agent previews each entity via `executeQuery` and renders ASCII line/bar charts (`references/charts/line_chart.py`, `references/charts/bar_chart.py`) so the user can validate output before the first refresh.

### Changed
- **Eventstream skills enhanced** (`eventstream-authoring-cli`, `eventstream-consumption-cli`; both shipped in v0.3.5) -- SKILL.md, core-reference, and API-endpoint refinements detailed below.
- **`eventstream-consumption-cli` — Custom Endpoint connection string retrieval recipe.** New "Get Custom Endpoint Connection String" section with full `az rest` CLI recipes (bash + PowerShell) showing the 2-step Topology API workflow: get topology → get source connection. Includes security guidance, multi-source disambiguation, Kafka producer config table, and MUST DO rule.
- **`EVENTSTREAM-AUTHORING-CORE.md` — Eventhouse ingestion modes guidance.** Added ProcessedIngestion as recommended API-automatable path with full example, DirectIngestion warning documenting the known UI-only data connection limitation, cross-skill collaboration pattern table, and CDC bracket-escaping fix.
- **Corrected Eventstream Definition API endpoints** -- All SKILL.md code blocks and eval Layer 1 regex assertions updated from unsupported `GET .../definition` / `PUT .../definition` to the official `POST .../getDefinition` / `POST .../updateDefinition` per Microsoft Learn docs.
- **`skills/search-consumption-cli`** -- reworked the skill description and triggers to lead with catalog-search framing ("search for an item", "search the catalog", "catalog search") and dropped discovery-verb-only triggers that did not reliably route to it. The skill now activates for cross-tenant "search the catalog for an item" requests, which is its actual purpose (the Fabric Catalog Search API). Reconciled the troubleshooting note on indexing lag (variable, not yet near-real-time; not a fixed ~24h).

### Fixed
- **`skills/dataflows-consumption-cli`** -- chart reference examples are now runnable as-written: bar-chart example passes the required `--labels`, `jq group_by` is preceded by `sort_by`, and the bar/pie renderers cast labels to `str` to avoid `TypeError` on numeric JSON categories.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-06-25

### Added
- **New skills `fabriciq-ontology-authoring-cli` and `fabriciq-ontology-consumption-cli`** — Fabric IQ Ontology (preview) support from the CLI. `fabriciq-ontology-authoring-cli` creates and evolves Ontology items (entity types, properties incl. timeseries, relationship types, and bindings to OneLake lakehouse or Eventhouse / KQL tables) via the Fabric item-definition REST API with a mandatory Preview & Confirm gate before any LRO write. `fabriciq-ontology-consumption-cli` reads Ontology items to produce agent grounding context and routes ontology-backed data queries by binding type to the matching per-datasource consumption skill (`eventhouse-consumption-cli`, `spark-consumption-cli`, `sqldw-consumption-cli`). Adds per-skill `references/` (including a shared ontology schema reference bundled into each skill), routing tests, integration evals, and full-eval plans.
- **New skill: `mlv-operations-cli`** -- Manage Materialized Lake View (MLV) refresh schedules and job execution via Fabric REST APIs. Provides scheduling and monitoring operations (9 endpoints):
  - **Schedule Management**: Create/list/update/delete refresh schedules (Cron, Daily, Weekly, Monthly)
  - **Job Execution**: Trigger on-demand refreshes, monitor job status/history, cancel running jobs
  - **UX Patterns**: Human-in-the-loop confirmations, step-by-step planning, iterative error handling
  - **Gap Documentation**: Transparently documents MLV discovery limitations — user must provide lakehouse ID and table names manually
- **Cross-skill integration** -- Routing from spark-authoring-cli, spark-operations-cli, FabricDataEngineer agent delegation
- **Competitive advantage** -- Fabric is first platform to offer conversational MLV scheduling (Databricks Lakeflow has no equivalent)

## [0.3.4] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Materialized Lake View (MLV) resources for `spark-authoring-cli`** -- two new resource documents:
  - `resources/materialized-lake-view-patterns.md` -- MLV design guidance, layering patterns, when to use MLVs vs. plain Delta tables, and the SQL-vs-PySpark authoring tradeoff (PySpark MLVs are lineage-schedule-refresh only and don't support on-demand notebook refresh).
  - `resources/mlv-incremental-refresh-patterns.md` -- refresh-readiness review workflow, IR-friendly syntax guide, full-refresh blocker catalog, and safe non-breaking rewrites.
- **MLV triggers + routing in `spark-authoring-cli/SKILL.md`** -- discovery phrases (`materialized lake view`, `MLV`, `CREATE MATERIALIZED LAKE VIEW`, `MLV incremental refresh`, `review MLV for incremental refresh`, `MLV refresh policy`, `schedule MLV refresh`), resource table entries, Rule 4 MLV routing, and a quick-start SQL example.
- **Cross-link from `e2e-medallion-architecture` PREFER section** -- points Silver/Gold layer authoring at the new MLV resources.
- **M language semantics reference for `dataflows-authoring-cli`** — new `references/m-language.md` covering language-side pitfalls confirmed live against a Fabric Dataflow Gen2 via `executeQuery`: `try` success vs failure record shapes (`[HasError, Value]` vs `[HasError, Error[Reason, Message, Detail]]`), `try ... otherwise` short-circuit semantics, per-cell error wrapping in `Table.TransformColumnTypes` and `Table.TransformColumns` (errors stored at the cell level — Arrow renders them as `null` but reads raise), `each` scoping divergence between row contexts (`Table.SelectRows`: `_` is a row record) and sub-table contexts (`Table.Group`: `_` is the sub-table — use `_[Col]` for the column-as-list), optional field access (`r[key]?`, `Record.FieldOrDefault`), quoted-identifier escaping (`#"..."`), error-record construction, and sandbox-disabled symbols. SKILL.md References table updated.
- **Source connector patterns for `dataflows-authoring-cli`** — new `references/connectors.md` covering the M-side source connector surface: live-verified function inventory (`Lakehouse.Contents`, `Sql.Database`, `Fabric.Warehouse`, `OData.Feed`, `Web.Contents`, `PowerPlatform.Dataflows`, `Snowflake.Databases`, `AzureStorage.DataLake`, `Excel.Workbook`, `Variable.Value`, `Html.Table`, `Csv.Document`, `Json.Document`, `Lines.FromBinary`), verified Lakehouse deep navigation (`workspaceId` → `lakehouseId` → flat-table `Name` index), `PowerPlatform.Dataflows` workspace/dataflow navigation (`{[Id="Workspaces"]}[Data]` → `workspaceId` → `dataflowName`), runtime-disabled functions (`Web.Page`, `Web.BrowserContents`), credentialed-connector argument shapes, the in-band `{"Error":"..."}` decoding contract for `executeQuery` Arrow responses, and the `[AllowCombine = true]` multi-source section attribute. Every behaviour claim was reproduced live via `executeQuery`.
- **Gemini CLI compatibility** -- new `compatibility/GEMINI.md` (a thin `@./AGENTS.md` import) is flattened to the public repo root by the release flow, so cloning the public repo enables Gemini CLI automatically.

### Changed
- **Compatibility files** (`compatibility/CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`) -- added pointers to the new MLV resources so cross-tool consumers route to the same guidance.
- **`skills/dataflows-authoring-cli/SKILL.md`** — added a requirement to name the definition parts (`mashup.pq`, `queryMetadata.json`, `.platform`) in the written summary so they survive transcript truncation; condensed the connector-types note to keep the YAML description within the 1023-char limit.

### Fixed
- **Cross-tool config files** -- removed dead "see DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md at repository root" references (the file never existed) from `AGENTS.md`, `.cursorrules`, and `.windsurfrules`. `AGENTS.md` and `.windsurfrules` now inline the `az login` token steps the link was meant to provide, matching `CLAUDE.md`.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- **`powerbi-report-planning`** — guided requirements-to-implementation workflow for new Power BI reports and dashboards built from semantic models, datasets, or PBIP projects. Use to plan then implement a report end-to-end: define audience, scope, page plan, design direction, dependencies, and delivery target, then produce a locked report spec with explicit approval before any PBIR authoring begins. For direct authoring without the planning gate, invoke `powerbi-report-authoring` directly.
- **`powerbi-report-design`** — visual design guidance for Power BI reports before any PBIR files are written. Use to choose tone, signature, page archetypes, chart types, layout, color, typography, theme direction, and accessibility approach; to redesign/restyle an existing report or apply a brand; or to critique chart and layout choices. Produces a design contract that downstream authoring consumes. Ships with 19 references covering accessibility, anti-patterns, page archetypes (analytical canvas, comparative benchmark, executive summary, narrative story, operational monitor), brownfield migration, chart selection, design brief, interactivity, pre-flight checklist, signatures, tone catalog, typography, and a visual cookbook.
- **`powerbi-report-authoring`** — create and modify Power BI report files in PBIR/PBIP format using the `powerbi-report-author` and `powerbi-desktop` CLIs. Implements an approved report spec or design brief; adds or edits pages, visuals, filters, slicers, bookmarks, themes, and formatting; validates PBIR and verifies rendering in Power BI Desktop. Ships with 23 references covering authoring, cartesian charts, color strategy, conditional formatting, expressions, filter pane, filters, formatting (overview + details), image, page formatting, Power BI Desktop, the `powerbi-report-author` CLI, re-theming, screenshot review, shape, slicers, table, textbox, theming, and version control. For open-ended visual design choices, invoke `powerbi-report-design` first.
- **`powerbi-report-management`** — manage Power BI report workspace items in Microsoft Fabric via `az rest` CLI against the Fabric REST API. Create reports from PBIR definitions, get or download report definitions, update report definitions or properties, list workspace reports, and delete reports. For report layout authoring (pages, visuals, filters, formatting), use `powerbi-report-authoring` instead.
- **`powerbi-authoring` plugin bundle expanded** — the dedicated `powerbi-authoring` plugin now ships the four new `powerbi-report-*` skills alongside `semantic-model-authoring` and `check-updates`, with the `powerbi-modeling-mcp` server pre-configured. Reinstall via `/plugin install powerbi-authoring@fabric-collection` to pick up the new report skills.

### Changed

- **`semantic-model-authoring` DAX performance references refined** — added Microsoft Learn further-reading links for DAX engine tracing, horizontal fusion, and Direct Lake query performance in `dax-perf-decision-guide.md` and `dax-perf-patterns.md`; renamed scenario-specific DAX examples to use generic names; rewrote DAX examples to be self-contained so they're easier to read on their own.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- **`semantic-model-authoring`** — develop and manage Power BI semantic models across Power BI Desktop, PBIP projects, and the Fabric Service. Covers creating models (Import, DirectQuery, Direct Lake), editing measures/tables/columns/relationships, deploying to Fabric workspaces, refreshing, configuring data sources and permissions, and DAX performance optimization. Ships with 11 reference guides (connection binding, DAX guidelines, DAX performance decision guide, DAX performance patterns, Direct Lake guidelines, modeling guidelines, naming conventions, PBIP, semantic-model AI readiness, semantic-model REST API, TMDL guidelines). **Replaces `powerbi-authoring-cli`.**
- **`semantic-model-consumption`** — execute raw DAX queries and inspect metadata of Microsoft Fabric Power BI semantic models via the MCP server `ExecuteQuery` tool. Use when you already know the DAX (EVALUATE statements) or need to inspect tables, columns, measures, relationships, and hierarchies via INFO functions. **Replaces `powerbi-consumption-cli`.**
- **`fabriciq`** — answer business questions by querying Power BI reports and dashboards through the FabricIQ MCP endpoint. Orchestrates artifact discovery, schema inspection, entity-value resolution, DAX generation, and query execution; returns plain-language answers. Use for natural-language questions about Power BI report/dashboard content (use `semantic-model-consumption` for raw DAX).
- **`FabricIQ` agent** — answers questions about Power BI artifacts (reports and semantic models) by discovering artifacts, inspecting metadata and schemas, resolving entity values, generating DAX, and executing queries against the Fabric MCP endpoint. Delegates to `fabriciq`.
- **Dedicated `powerbi-authoring` plugin bundle** — ships `semantic-model-authoring` and `check-updates` with the `powerbi-modeling-mcp` server (`@microsoft/powerbi-modeling-mcp`) pre-configured for fine-grained semantic-model modeling operations. Install via `/plugin install powerbi-authoring@fabric-collection`.
- **`dataflows-authoring-cli` reference docs (3 new)** — `output-destinations.md` (Lakehouse/Warehouse/SQL DB output destination patterns including staging behavior, schema mapping, and refresh semantics), `connection-management.md` (creating, binding, and rotating connection IDs for Dataflows Gen2), and `mashup-preview.md` (inspecting and validating Power Query M before publishing).
- **`spark-operations-cli` automated diagnostic workflow** — new `references/automated-diagnostic-workflow.md` for end-to-end Spark/Livy diagnostics: job triage → executor/driver log mining → Spark Advisor findings → mitigation recommendations.
- **`synapse-migration` deep resources (12 new)** — capacity sizing, connector refactoring, external Hive Metastore migration, feature parity matrix, lake database migration, library compatibility, migration gotchas, migration orchestrator, migration report, security and governance, Spark item migration, Spark pool migration, and validation/testing.
- **`EVENTHOUSE-CONSUMPTION-CORE` common reference** — shared Eventhouse/KQL consumption patterns surfaced via the `fabric-authoring` plugin bundle.

### Changed

- **`powerbi-authoring-cli` renamed to `semantic-model-authoring`** — aligns the skill name with the underlying Microsoft Fabric / Power BI artifact (a *semantic model*) rather than the surface tool. Same coverage of model authoring plus an expanded reference library. Re-invoke as `semantic-model-authoring` going forward.
- **`powerbi-consumption-cli` renamed to `semantic-model-consumption`** — same rationale; same DAX query / metadata surface. Re-invoke as `semantic-model-consumption` going forward.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- **`activator-authoring-cli`** — create alerts, notifications, and automated actions on Fabric data and events via Fabric REST API and `az rest` CLI. Covers Activator/Reflex item creation, trigger configuration, action wiring (Teams messages, emails, Fabric item runs), and connections to Eventhouse, Eventstream, Real-Time Hub, and Digital Twin Builder.
- **`activator-consumption-cli`** — read-only inspection of existing Activator alerts, notifications, and automated actions via `az rest`. List alerts in a workspace, inspect alert configuration, decode `ReflexEntities.json` definitions.

### Changed

- **`spark-diagnostics-cli` renamed to `spark-operations-cli`** — aligned with the three-category naming convention (`-authoring-`, `-consumption-`, `-operations-`). Same skill, same diagnostic surface (failed Spark jobs, unhealthy Livy sessions, OOM/shuffle/skew, driver/executor logs, Spark Advisor findings) — only the name has changed. Re-invoke as `spark-operations-cli` going forward.

### Fixed

- **`/plugin update` now works again for users who installed under the legacy `skills-for-fabric@fabric-collection` id.** When the bundle was renamed in 0.3.0 (`skills-for-fabric` → `fabric-skills`), the old plugin id was dropped from `marketplace.json`, which silently broke `/plugin update skills-for-fabric@fabric-collection` for everyone still on the legacy id (`Plugin "skills-for-fabric" not found in marketplace`). The legacy id is restored as a deprecated alias of `fabric-skills@fabric-collection` — running `/plugin update` under either name now pulls the canonical `fabric-skills` payload. To migrate your installed entry to the canonical id (optional, recommended cleanup): `/plugin uninstall skills-for-fabric@fabric-collection` then `/plugin install fabric-skills@fabric-collection`.
- **`check-updates` skill works inside Copilot CLI plugin installs.** The skill assumed a `package.json` and a `.git/` directory at the install root, but the Copilot CLI plugin install layout (`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/fabric-collection/fabric-skills/`) has neither — only `.github/plugin/plugin.json`. Step 1 (read local version), Step 2 (parse repository URL), and Method A (`git fetch origin main`) now read the manifest path that matches the actual install layout. The "Update Available" banner no longer references the `install.ps1` / `install.sh` scripts that were removed from the public release in 0.3.0.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- **Plugin bundles for focused installation**
  - `fabric-skills` - complete bundle for Fabric authoring, consumption, operations, migration, and end-to-end architecture workflows.
  - `fabric-authoring` - developer-oriented skills for REST APIs, CLI automation, notebooks, T-SQL, KQL, Eventstreams, Dataflows Gen2, semantic models, and medallion architecture.
  - `fabric-consumption` - read-only and interactive exploration skills for SQL, Spark/Lakehouse, Power BI semantic models, Eventhouse/KQL, Eventstreams, Dataflows Gen2, and catalog search.
  - `fabric-operations` - diagnostics-focused bundle for warehouse performance investigation.
- **Dataflows Gen2 skills**
  - `dataflows-authoring-cli` for creating, updating, and managing Dataflows Gen2 definitions and Power Query M mashups.
  - `dataflows-consumption-cli` for inspecting, monitoring, and exploring Dataflows Gen2 artifacts.
  - `dataflows-save-as-authoring-cli` for Dataflows Gen1 to Gen2 save-as upgrade workflows, readiness assessment, risk checks, and validation.
- **Real-Time Intelligence skills**
  - `eventhouse-consumption-cli` for read-only KQL queries and schema discovery.
  - `eventhouse-authoring-cli` for KQL table, ingestion, policy, function, and materialized-view management.
  - `eventstream-consumption-cli` for inspecting and monitoring Eventstream topologies.
  - `eventstream-authoring-cli` for creating and deploying Eventstream sources, transformations, and destinations.
- **Search and discovery**
  - `search-consumption-cli` for finding Fabric items across the OneLake catalog by name, description, workspace, and type.
- **Migration skills**
  - `databricks-migration` for Databricks to Fabric migration planning and code mapping.
  - `synapse-migration` for Azure Synapse Analytics to Fabric migration.
  - `hdinsight-migration` for Azure HDInsight to Fabric migration.
- **Power BI authoring coverage**
  - `powerbi-authoring-cli` is now included in the authoring and full bundles.

### Changed

- **Plugin installation is now bundle-scoped.** Installing `fabric-authoring`, `fabric-consumption`, or `fabric-operations` installs only the skills and resources for that bundle instead of copying the entire repository.
- **Plugin packages are self-contained.** Public plugin folders include the materialized skills, agents, common references, and MCP configuration needed for GitHub-based plugin installation.
- **MCP configuration is scoped per bundle.** `fabric-consumption` and `fabric-skills` include the Power BI query MCP server configuration; authoring and operations bundles do not include unused MCP configuration.
- **`sqldw-monitoring-cli` was renamed to `sqldw-operations-cli`.** The new name aligns with the authoring, consumption, and operations skill categories.
- **Catalog search is now part of item discovery guidance.** Skills can use the Fabric Catalog Search API alongside list-and-filter workflows.
- **Version updated to `0.3.0`.**
